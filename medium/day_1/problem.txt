Write a program in C++ to take n integers from user and sort them.

Constraints:
The code must be written in C++ language.
You are not allowed to use any predefined functions like sort().
You are not allowed to use any loop like for, while, do-while.

INPUT:
The first line contains one integer t (1<= t <= 10)  — the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines:
the first line contains one integer n (1≤n≤30000);
the second line contains n integers a[1], a[2], … , a[n] (0 <= a[i] <= 5000000)

OUTPUT:
For each test case, print the n integer in a single line, sorted in ascending order.
